	- Changing one of the "Recent changes options" will perform a "hard refresh" like it did before, removing all items from the list.
	- Old items (as defined by "days" / "limit") are removed.
- Fixed small bug where RCMOptions didn't show correct value for days/limit when it was a custom value.

	- Fixed bug were it was possible for a user's returned avatar being added to page without being scaled down.

- RCMModal now keeps track of it's retrieved modal factory.
- [Bug] Closing out of a modal while it's content is loading no longer tries to add content to non-existent modal.

- [Bug] Discussion timestamp and title ajax load weren't being added when "grouped recent changes" was toggled off.


== V2.2 - 26 November 2016 ==
- Reworked loading:
	- Translations must be loaded before managers are initialized.
	- siteinfo and other 1-off info must be loaded before rc data (necessary for discussions).
- Ajax diff now loads local css (instead of hardcoding style which required a white background).
- SVGs reworked to use <symbol> and <use> tags.
- Wikia Discussion system added to script.
	- Currently only grabs up to limit of 50. Will use RC options if less than 50 (potentially doubling total results).
	- Discussions display avatar for users (since the api returns the links).
	- Can be turned on with data-discussions-enabled attribute.
	- Added a toggle option to turn discussions on/off.


== V2.1 - 20 November 2016 ==
- Ajax diff timestamps now link to diff as well as have edit buttons next to them (and the new edit has an undo button). Added to mirror normal diff behavior.
- Ajax diff also shows the "m" minor icon. Added to mirror normal diff behavior.
- [Bug] Fixed issue with retrieving thread names that had specific special characters in them due to being escaped for html rather than urls.

- Increased modal font-size a bit.
- Flashing "New" page title now also includes number of changes.


== V1.2.9d - 16 October 2016 ==
- Added 3 new options for notifications as per request: data-notifications-hideusers=, &notifications_hideusers, &notifications_enabled. These control when notifications are sent out.
- As per request, added a data-ajaxlinks= option. This will make the diff/upload log links behave same as icon when clicked.

== V1.2.9c - 15 October 2016 ==

- Fixed small localization bug. I assumed all `rclinks` localizations had br tag. Ones that do not (oc, vi) show an unhandled "$3" string variable.

- Favicon images that open the "info banner" now display cursor:pointer; when hovered over.

- changelog file started (changes before this point added retroactively)

== V1.1.1 - 30 July 2015 ==
- Bug fixes:
	- "messages" loading issues fixed
	- forum/board messages group properly
	- auto refresh fixed


== V1.1.0 - 28 July 2015 ==
- Major rewrite using MediaWiki API directly (instead of parsing RSS feed). Code now uses "code.2.js" for file.
- Important notes:
	- "&subdir" removed, and "&scriptdir" added (may be necessary for non-wikia wikis, see above). ex: &scriptdir=w/
	- "data-params" now offers much more support. "days" and "limit" now work up to same amount as normal for each wiki on the list. As such this should be limited to a few days / a lower limit to avoid loading potentially thousands of changes. Individual wikis can have these limits modified using "&params"
- Changes:
	- Changed translating to use the exact i18n info from Wikia's github for RC_TEXT. Loads RC_TEXT from the server based on your language.
	- Boards/walls now also check for [ restore, delete, remove ] for "replies" instead of assuming it's the actual thread.
	-  All (normal) RecentChanges params supported, except "hideenhanced", "from", and viewing a select namespace.
	- Bot edits can now be shown (off by default), and "minor" edits are now marked.
	- gApp instance turned into the RecentChangesMultiple class (to potentially run multiple for whatever reason, plus I prefer "traditional" OO class structures)
		- As such, #rc-content-multiple id should now be a .rc-content-multiple class to allow for multiple instances (although using ids is still supported)
	- Additional Special:RecentChanges CSS classes used.
	- Rewrote RC / RCList objects (to bring a little more inline with how it's structure in mw system)
	- New "WikiData" class for storing wiki-specific data in a more understandable way, while also providing helper methods
	- data-groupaddcategories support removed
